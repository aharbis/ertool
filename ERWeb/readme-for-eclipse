This directory simply houses some eclipse project files and symbolic links to the src and bin directories of the ER Tool codebase.
When built using jmake, the Java binaries (class files) are archived into a jar and written to the dist directory.

The tool is executed with a small shell script, name ertool, that builds and exports the Java class path and runs the
executable class com.ibm.datapower.er.ERFrameworkRun.  A list of acceptable options is available by running the tool without
positional parameters.  The ertool script sets up the class path to be the dist directory so that it can load a distribution
approved build from the jar files in it.  For development purposes, there is a statement, commented out by default, to set the class path
to the bin directory, which is where eclipse will output all build artifacts.  It may or may not be a good idea to just make a special
development copy of ertool that just looks at the bin directory, but at this point the first option seems more fitting.
